Entrypoint Assist is a utility program designed to create ancillary files for use with the Digital Video Plug-In.  Entrypoint Assist reads multiplexed MPEG files or realtime files containing MPEG streams and produces:
<UL>
	<LI>Entrypoint files in several formats
	<UL>
		<LI>Digital Video Plug-In for MediaMogul 2.2
		<LI>Digital Video Plug-In for MediaMogul 2.1
		<LI>Pink entrypoint list
		<LI>Philips VCD entrypoint list
	</UL>
	<LI>Delta files &#42;
	<LI>Log files
</UL>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&#42; Please note that Delta files are only needed for use with the OS-9 versions of the <CODE>master</CODE> software.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There are versions of Entrypoint Assist available for Macintosh, PC &#40;Windows&#41;, and CD-i player platforms.  
<P>
If no selections are made in the Entrypoint Assist window &#40;Macintosh or PC versions&#41; or no options are entered in the command line &#40;CD-i player version&#41; all the above files will be produced when Entrypoint Assist is run.  Each of the files produced will have the same base filename as the source file with the following extensions:

<P>
The default behavior of Entrypoint Assist is to produce a file containing all entrypoints from the source MPEG.  If you require fewer entrypoints, this can be modified by entering a default number of seconds between entrypoints.  The minimum number of seconds between entrypoints is entered in the Macintosh and Windows versions.  In the CD-i player version, this is entered as an option on the command line using the <CODE>-s seconds</CODE> option, where <CODE>seconds</CODE> is the number of seconds desired between entrypoints.
<P>
The log file produced by Entrypoint Assist is useful for determining information about the entrypoints are included in the entrypoint file.  It contains a listing of the number of the entrypoint, the SMPTE timecode, the raw sector number, byte offset, and pack offset for each included entrypoint.
<P>
For further information about Entrypoint Assist, please refer to the manual which you received along with your Digital Video Plug-In.
