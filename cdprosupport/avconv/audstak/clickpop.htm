There are a couple of circumstances where clicks and pops may be apparent in sounds after conversion with Audio Stack.  Of course, if your source material contains clicks or pops, converting it with Audio Stack will not remove these.
<P>
If the source material contains levels which are clipped, even if this is not noticeably audible, this can cause an audible click in the converted sound sample.  The solution for this is to make sure your source material is not clipped.
<P>
The other possibility occurs only when converting to C mono.  With some source material file lengths, clicks can be introduced during the conversion process.  Changing the source file length will eliminate this.
<P>
On a related note, make sure your audio fades up and fades down over at least 100 milliseconds at the start and end of the sample.  Otherwise you may get a perceived click.
<P>
  The current version of Audio Stack is 1.0.4.  There is no planned update.
