<FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the "Autoinclude MPEGAV files as tracks" checkbox is checked</FONT> in the Preferences dialog of PC VCD 2.0 Toolkit, MPEGAV assets are added as separate tracks in the Track Manager <B>each</B> time they are added as assets in the Asset Manager.  This also applies if the <B>same</B> MPEGAV asset is accidentally added two(or more) times to the Asset Manager.  The asset will only be displayed <B>once</B> in the Asset Manager, but will be listed as a separate track in the Tracks Manager as many times as it is added.  This can significantly reduce disc space available.  To avoid this problem either:

<B><LI></B>Check the Tracks Manager for duplicate MPEGAV files before building.
<B><LI></B>Manually remove all duplicate tracks in the Tracks Manager.
<B><LI></B>Turn off the "Autoinclude" preference.  If you do this, however, be sure to add the MPEGAV files manually to the Tracks Manager if you desire VCD1.X compatibility.</OL></FONT>
