<b>MAKING HYBRID DISCS WITH CD-IT! ALL</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>1. </b>Choose Command-3 Mac/Iso Hybrid in CD-ROM menu<p>
<b>2. </b>Use hard drive partition or create Temporary Partition under Options
Menu if necessary.  If you choose an existing partition, it <b>cannot</b> be
the startup volume.  The partition needs to be large enough to fit all your
files. Temp. Partitions should mount automatically on the desktop: give it a
name.  This name, and all the other names of <b>ISO</b> files &amp; folders,
should be ISO 9660 compliant  (i.e. 8.3, capital letters, numbers, underscores)
if you want maximum cross-platform compatilbility.  Name Mac-<b>only</b> files
per Mac naming convention.<p>
<b>3. </b>Drag the shared HFS/ISO data files/folders to the HFS partition.
Often it is easiest to put all shared data into one folder. <b>Remember:</b>
the number of files and icons can affect load/access times to the cd.  On a
Mac, if all/most of your files have fancy icons, the time to display them on
screen will increase significantly.  If these files are at the root of the cd,
mount times may increase.<p>
<b>4.</b> Make an alias of all folders/files meant to be shared.  This usually
means just one alias of the folder containing all the shared data.  Drag the
alias(es) to the desktop.<p>
<b>5.</b> Create a folder on the desktop for your ISO data &amp; name it.<p>
<b>6.</b> Drag the just created alias(es) to the ISO folder.  Be sure to remove
the "<i>alias</i>" from the alias name. Then delete any copies of these aliases
from the desktop &amp; empty the trash.<p>
<b>7.</b> Drag any MacHFS-only files/folders to the HFS partition.  Since you
do not make any aliases of these, they will only be available to the Mac.  If
you want all data to be available to all platforms you can skip this step.<p>
<b>8. </b>Build your HFS volume by clicking on "Mac" button in the Hybrid disc
main screen.  Then choose the hard drive partition (or the temporary partition
you've just created), be sure "<i>Don't Copy Free Space</i>" is checked.
(<b>Remember: </b>"<i>Don't Copy Free Space</i>" just skips free sectors at the
<b>end</b> of a partition.  Any free sectors between file segments, i.e. wasted
space, <b>is</b> copied over to your cd image.  To minimize wasted space, be
sure to run a utility such as Norton Speed Disk to defragment the partition
<b>before</b> you begin CD-It! All.)  Click ok.<p>
<b>9.</b> Drag any ISO-only files and folders to the ISO folder.  These will
not be available to the Mac.  If you want all data to be available to all
platforms you can skip this step.<p>
<b>10.</b> Build your ISO image by clicking on "ISO" button in the Hybrid disc
main screen. Choose "<i>Create a New 9660 image file</i>".  Be sure that you
<b>uncheck</b><i> "Resolve Aliases"</i> (this will put only one copy of the
data on the disc) and that "<i>Allow Mac/ISO Common Data</i>" is checked.Then
highlite your ISO folder, click the "<i>Select </i><tt>&lt;ISO_folder&gt;</tt>"
button just above the checkboxes.<p>
<b>11.</b> In the ISO 9660 Builder dialog box, choose <b>CD-ROM XA</b>.  Be
sure "<i>Append Version Number (;1)</i>"is checked.  Despite what the manual
says, be sure to <b>uncheck</b> <i>"Use Apple Extensions"</i>:  this means that
the ISO 9660 volume should ignore the HFS resource fork.  The Mac HFS volume
will still see the resource fork.  If you neglect to do this, Sun workstations
may give file errors.   ISO9660 naming is best for cross-platform
compatibility. Consult the manual about the other options in this dialog if you
want to customize further. Click on "<i>Build Image</i>".   Unless you want to
change the image name, click "<i>Save</i>".<p>
<b>12.</b> Doing a "<i>Check Speed</i>" is recommended, but optional.  If you
are well familiar with recording similar images, you might skip this step.<p>
<b>13.</b> Write the CD.<p>
