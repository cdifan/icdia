<TR><TD><B>CD-ROM</B></TD><TD>Yellow Book</TD><TD>Computer data.  Data written to disc as separate files, as on computer hard disks.  Subdivided into Mode 1/Mode 2(Forms 1 and 2), then further into ISO9660/High Sierra or non-ISO (e.g. Mac HFS). </TR>
<TR><TD><B>CD-i</B></TD><TD>Green Book</TD><TD>CD Interactive.  Most data written to disc in interleaved fashion, to facilitate access times.  A version of the OS-9 operating system, CD-RTOS (CD Realtime OS) is built into the standard.  MPEG1 compressed video & audio is also built in.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B>VCD</B></TD><TD>White Book</TD><TD>Video CD, a.k.a. Karaoke.  All data (audio, stills, motion video) is in MPEG1 format.  Requires a CD-i application on the disc which allows play on CD-i players (and usually adds increased functionality over basic VCD players).  This is one type of CD-i/CD-XA Bridge Disc.</TD</TR>

<TR Align=Left><TH>Mixed Mode</TH><TD>Audio starts at Track 2, non-muting audio players will play Track 1 as static.</TD><TD>ROM data is in Track 1. </TD><TD>Most Macs and MPCs can read ROM data.</TD><TD>There is potential for playing full volume static if non-muting audio player attempts to play Track 1(ROM track).</TR>

<TR><TD><B>Enhanced Audio Product</B><BR>
(a.k.a. Selectware)</TD><TD>Audio tracks begin with Track 2.</TD><TD>ROM data is in Track 1 and contains audio warning. </TD><TD>Currently unavailable for Mac, MPCs may need additional software.</TD><TD>Less than 1 second of static is heard on non-muting audio players, then an audible warning is made requesting that the user advance to the next track.  Possibility of full volume static.  Format is not available for the Mac.</TR>
<TR><TD><B>CD+</B><BR>
(a.k.a. CD-Plus,Stamped Multisession, Blue Book)</TD><TD>Works in all audio players. Audio is in first session.</TD><TD>ROM data is in 2nd session. </TD><TD>Macs and MPCs require multisession capability.</TD><TD>Multisession hardware and software must be available.

<TR><TD><B>CD+G</B><BR>
(a.k.a. CD +Graphics)</TD><TD>Works in all audio players.</TD><TD>ROM data is in subcode. </TD><TD>Macs, MPCs can play audio only.</TD><TD>CD+G requires special players and have seen use mainly in applications such as Karaoke.  Only very limited graphics and text can be stored in subcode channels.  This format has probably been superceded by the VCD (White Book) standard.</TR>

<TR><TD><B>Mac HFS/ISO9660 Hybrid Discs</B><BR>
</TD><TD>None.</TD><TD>Track 1</TD><TD>Macs can read both the HFS and ISO9660 data, PCs only the ISO9660 data.</TD><TD>The ISO volume and the HFS volume are separately referenced in the pre-gap of Track 1.  Often all the data and the PC applications are put into the ISO volume(and aliased in the HFS volume), while the Mac applications are put into the HFS volume.  This way, the data is only on the disc once.  The Mac will mount the HFS volume only, unless a separate mounting utility is used to mount the ISO volume.</TD></TR>
