<H2><CENTER><HR>Disc Recording Secrets</CENTER></H2>

<P>Recording CD's places a high demand on the hardware you use, and
your computer's system resources. In particular, problems with data
transfer may occasion the ubiquitous "buffer underrun" error so many
have run across. This message is generated by the disc recorder when
its buffer empties and no other data is coming down the pipe.
Possible ways to cure the problem include:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT SIZE=4>Use a dedicated, high performance hard
   drive.</FONT><BR>
   
   Choose one which is designed for AV applications, either by smart
   firmware or embedded servo. Either of these techniques will help
   avoid or eliminate thermal recalibrations which interrupt data
   flow to the recorder. And they will also usually have faster seek
   times and burst transfer rates. Buy one which has as large an
   onboard buffer as possible.<BR>
   
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE=4>Use a high performance computer.</FONT><BR>
   
   The Mac or PC you use <I>can </I> &nbsp;affect data transfer. The
   quality of the SCSI bus on Macs can vary, with many of the older
   030 and 040 boxes being relatively slow. The kind of bus (e.g.
   ISA, PCI) and the model host adaptor you use can affect SCSI
   performance significantly. Even if you are using a Mac with a
   built-in SCSI bus, it is often a good idea to use a high
   performance SCSI host adaptor, particularly on newer Macs with PCI
   buses. On a PC, it is always a good idea to use a PCI host adaptor
   rather than older ISA versions.<BR>
   
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE=4>Try not to tax the file system.</FONT><BR>
   
   Avoid putting hundreds or thousands of files in a single
   subdirectory. Keep the structure of your directory tree wide and
   shallow, rather than narrow and deep. This speeds drive access.<BR>
  
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE=4>Defragment your hard drive.</FONT><BR>
   
   Again, this speeds drive access.<BR>
   
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE=4>Use a recorder with a large buffer.</FONT><BR>
   
   This helps to insure that the recorder can withstand periods of
   time when no data is flowing down the SCSI bus. The more the
   merrier, and some recorders allow you to add more yourself.
   Purchase a recorder with at least 512K of buffer, and preferably
   1024K or more.<BR>

   
   <LI><FONT SIZE=4>Use hard disk caching software. </FONT><BR>
   
   On some systems, this may help accomplish the same thing as an
   onboard hard drive buffer.<BR>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE=4>Utilize any
   </FONT><I><FONT SIZE=4>special options</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=4>&nbsp;the recording software offers.</FONT><BR>
   
   For instance, in CD-It! All versions 2.5.8 through 2.5.10 there are a couple hidden 
   recording modes available. <BR><BR>
   <UL> 
   <LI>One, the "Blind" mode, is useful only for versions of the
   Philips CDD2000 recorder with v1.20 firmware or earlier.  This mode is obsolete, since
   the firmware can now be updated to 1.26 (as of this writing.)
   <BR><BR>
   <LI>The other, "Polled" mode, makes the data transfer slower but more secure, sometimes helping when a 
   drive has buffer underruns without any reasonable cause.
   <BR><BR>
   <LI>Press the <B>spacebar</B> and either <B>P</B>(for Polled) or <B>B</B>(for Blind) and click 
   on the <B>version number</B> (in the main CD-IT!ALL dialog) to switch between the various modes.
<BR><BR>    
   <LI>Normally there is NO NEED to change the mode! In Toast 3.0 it has been
   removed because Toast now uses the optimal mode for each drive. Toast 3.0 also offers
   use of the Mac's RAM for buffering purposes.</UL>
<BR>

   <LI><FONT SIZE=4>Record on a
   </FONT><I><FONT SIZE=4>dedicated</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=4>&nbsp;computer
   (or turn everything else off.)</FONT><BR>
   
   If you use the computer for things other than recording discs, try
   to turn all those things off before starting a recording session.
   On a PC, this means TSR or background programs, unneeded device
   drivers, etc. Remark-out the lines in system files (autoexec.bat,
   config.sys, system.ini, win.ini, etc) or use different versions of
   the system files.<BR><BR>
   
   On a Mac, it is usually simplest to turn off all extensions by
   rebooting with the shift key held down.
   
   <P>And, of course, NEVER run another program during a recording
   session. Not even Windows or MacOs functions/utilities. Just don't
   touch nothin'.</P>
