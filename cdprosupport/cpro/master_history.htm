<P>

<B>4.1.1:</B> this was the first version capable of handling MPEG. <P>


<B>4.1.2:</B> this version was cranked out in a hurry to handle Karaoke CD1.0 spec.
It saw limited/restricted distribution - on a as-is basis.<P>


<B>4.1.3:</B> this version cleaned up the worst of 4.1.2 problems,
and even some 4.1.1 problems, and was be White Book 1.1 compliant.  <P>


<B>4.2:</B> White Book 1.1 support. Eliminates the nuisance of the delta file.
Obsolete and superceded keywords made illegal or optional; new script syntax.<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>The "delta_file from <FILE>" syntax is obsolete and ignored by 4.2 and
became alien syntax (read: will stop with an error) in subsequent rev. of vcdmaster.<P>


"non_real_time" has been added as an alternative to "real_time mpeg"
streams. This option defeats the sectorization of the mpeg data as
normally prescribed by the SCR values in the data.<P>


4.2 release of master and vcdmaster take the scrambled state of a rtf into consideration when including it in the disc image.<P>

<PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>           \          final disc
            \
   rtf       \  scrambled   | unscrambled
  --------------------------------------
   scrambled  | no change   | unscramble
              |             |
  unscrambled | scamble     | no change
              |             |</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></PRE>


Also, vcdmaster 4.2 did support chapter marks through the .pkl file
mechanism. The problem was that there was no simple method to connect a
byte offset in the .pkl with a real-live-timecode. </BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<B>4.3:</B> vcdmaster 4.3 allowed chapter marks to be identified using smpte
timecodes in the master script. Integrated Philips scan-list generation
capability (generates the scan list as the a/v sequence is copied into
image).<P>


<B>4.3.1:</B> Bugs repaired, no new features.<P>





<B>4.3.2:</B>  A few bug fixes.<P>

<B>4.4:</B>  Most current version.  PC, Mac only. White Book 2.0, Windows 95/NT compatible.<P>
<BR>
<B>Note:</B>  There have been some instances where obscure features have been broken in new releases. For example, the internal (included in green file as
pre-amble) entrypoint data feature was broken between 4.1 and 4.2. As
far as we know, all the "obscure" features in 4.4 are 100%
operational. If you rely upon some obscure feature, especially a
undocumented feature, we recommend that you build an image with 4.4,
and test the result before you delete each and every copy of the
previous version.<P>
