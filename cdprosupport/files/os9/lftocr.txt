lftocr is an OS-9 program that takes a text file made on a Sun or PC
containing Line Feed or Carriage Return + Line Feed characters
as end-of-line, and converts those to Carriage Return characters as
required by OS-9. lftocr does NOT make a copy of your text file.
Instead, it ALTERS the original text file for OS-9 end-of-line
characters.

lftocr can take wild cards and perform the conversion on multiple files.
The conversion should not be done on utility, plugin or other OS-9
files, as it can render them useless.  Text files only.


The syntax:         lftocr filename

wildcard example:   lftocr *.txt
