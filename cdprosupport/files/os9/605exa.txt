					**** SUPPLEMENT ****



 



1. The power-up ROM release and copyright messages the 605 sends to an 

external terminal contain the line "ROM release number:  x.x". The

number x.x must be 1.3 or later. Players made after Feb 1994 usually

have the required ROMs.  Earlier players must be verfied. ROM release

versions earlier than 1.3 will not perform reliably with the new Exabyte

modules.



2. The table indicates what tape format will be written given the tape drive 

and descriptor used. A drive can READ any format it can WRITE.  i.e. an 8205 

can write LOW and MED density tapes, and can therefore read ONLY LOW and MED 

density tapes.

      ^---TAPE DRIVE MODEL



Legend:



NO - causes 249 errors or other problems

LOW - low density 8200 format

MED - medium density 8205 or 8505 compressed format (also called 8200C)

HIGH - high density 8500 format

VHIGH - very high density 8505 format

LAST - writes in whatever mode tape drive was last set - dangerous!









Notes:



8200:	Use mt00 only.



8205:	Use mt14 to make 8200 compatible tapes, readable by ALL machines.

		Use other descriptors according to table.



8500:	Use mt14 to make 8200 compatible tapes, readable by ALL machines.

		Use other descriptors according to table.



8505:	Use mt14 to make 8200 compatible tapes, readable by ALL machines.

		Use other descriptors according to table.

	



1. the tape command MUST include the descriptor name for all machines, 

	EXCEPT the 8200. Example:  tape -r /mt00   rewinds tape on all machines.



2. the default blocking factor (20) yields about 8 Meg/min. writing speed, 

slightly faster on reads.  The maximum blocking factor is 64, which yields 

slightly faster writes.  Blocking factors other than 20 MUST be noted on the 

tape label, otherwise the tar utility will not be able to determine the 

factor when read on other systems.





3. Example tar & tape command lines:  



tar -cvf /mt14 AUDIO VIDEO	

tar -cvf /mt00 -b 64 AUDIO VIDEO

tar -cvf /mt00 /h0 

tar -xvf /mt14

tar -xvf /mt00 AUDIO 



tape /mt14 -r       (rewinds tape) 







MediaMogul Users - Installation:



1. If the driver package is on PC floppy:

		type: chd /pcd0h

		type: dsave -ensrb=100 /h0

		type: umacs /h0/mm_customize



		add this line:

  

			load -d /h0/SBSCSID/OBJS/*



		use ESC-Z to save mm_customize and exit umacs

		reset the 605 and restart MediaMogul



2. If the driver package is in a tar file (605EXA.TAR):

		

		copy 605EXA.TAR to the root of /h0

		type: tar -xvf /h0/605EXA.TAR

		type: attr -pee /h0/SBSCSID/OBJS/*

		MM 2.2 users---type: umacs /h0/mm_cust
  <MM 2.1 users--type: umacs /h0/mm_customize)
		

		add this line:

			load -d /h0/SBSCSID/OBJS/*


		use ESC-Z to save mm_customize and exit umacs

		reset the 605 and restart MediaMogul
