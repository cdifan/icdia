                         READ ME FOR cdi_vol SUBROUTINE



This subroutine adjusts global volumes for ADPCM audio and DV audio at the same time, via the values
of Mastervol and VOLVAR. The syntax for this subroutine is ñCall_bg cdi_vol <volvar>", where volvar
is the variable(A,B,C,...) that is used in the cdi_dvpl VOLVAR parameter. When $MM_incvolume, 
$MM_decvolume, or $MM_setvolume hotspots are selected, the mastervolume(in video environment) and 
the DV volvar are incremented and decremented accordingly, with appropriate bounds checking. When 
$DV_incvolume, $DV_decvolume, or $DV_setvolume hotspots are selected, only the mastervolume is updated
by cdi_vol since cdi_dvpl updates the VOLVAR. The hotspot must have the appropriate command for the 
type of video currently playing.  This means you need one menu which has $MM_ command hotspots for 
when ADPCM audio is playing, and another menu with $DV_ command hotspots for when DV is playing. 

cdi_vol.tar contains the cdi_vol subroutine, as well as as an example script, menus, and assets.  
In order to use this subroutine, you will need to untar the file, copy cdi_vol to the SUBROUT folder, 
and then be sure to give it execute attributes, e.g. ñattr -peepwwprr cdi_volî.

This subroutine is at present unsupported, and you use it at your own risk.
