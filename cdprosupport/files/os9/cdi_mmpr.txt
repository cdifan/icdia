                     cdi_mmpr - Text File Print Utility

"cdi_mmpr" is a utility to print out text files via the /p parallel or /t2 serial player ports 
from within a CDi application. Place the cdi_mmpr.tar file in a new directory, then extract it 
using a "tar -xvf cdi_mmpr.tar" command, or equivalent.  The Readme note contained in the tar 
file will explain things further.
