CHANGES MADE FOR VERSION 2.5.1:
 ===============================


 SOFTWARE UPDATE
 
 - CD-i and CD-DA formats now correctly work on the Yamaha CDR100.
 
 - Preferences are now correctly saved to disk.
 
 - The EJECT command now works with the Kodak PCD600.  Consequently, you can
   use the Kodak PCD600 with the Kodak disc transporter.
 
 - The compare files feature now works correctly.  Previously, it occasionally
   crashed CD-IT!ALL when analyzing files of different sizes.
 
 The following updates are applicable to System 7.5 systems only:
 
 - The Drag Manager now correctly highlights the main window.
 
 - The Drag Manager now correctly handles inappropriate items that were dropped
   on the main window.
 
 
 DOCUMENTATION NOTES
 
 The following information is provided as update notes to the revision C
 CD-IT!ALL manual:
 
 - On a JVC XR-W1001, "write disc" is equivalent to "write session."
 
 - You cannot write more than three sessions with a Ricoh RS-9200CD.
 
 - If you get verification and/or read errors with the Philips CDD522 recorder,
   you need to upgrade to the CDD522 firmware version 1.02 or higher.
 
 - Version 1.0 of the Reflection Systems RF4100 firmware does not always
   correctly report the available space on a multisession disc.  Consequently,
   the software allows you to write more data than actually fits on the disc.
   The resulting disc cannot be used.  This firmware will be fixed in an
   upcoming release.
 
 - To create a CD-DA disc, select AUDIO TRACKS from the CD-ROM pulldown menu.
   Regardless of the currently displayed CD format, the AUDIO button appears.
   Click on the AUDIO button to add tracks.  To make an audio only disc, do not
   use the DATA button.
 
 - Yamaha CDR100 players take a long time to eject a disc when recording is
   complete.  The Mac is virtually frozen until the disc ejects.
 
 - Use certified 4x discs in the Yamaha CDR100.  Using other disc types
   increases the likelihood of recording failure due to media.
 
 - Yamaha CDR100 firmware prior to version 1.03 is known at times to return the
   wrong data during verification.  To properly verify the disc, place it in
   another CD-ROM drive and use the COMPARE command.
 
 - If you check USE TEXT MARKERS or USE NUMERIC MARKERS indexes for CD-DA
   tracks, any SoundDesigner II index marks in the files are automatically
   placed on the disc so an audio player that understands indexes can use them.
   Markers placed in SoundDesigner II files can be either in text or numeric
   format.
 
 - A 22M overhead is associated with the first session, and a 13M overhead is
   associated with each additional session.
 
 - Always run a disk optimizer on your source volume before you write.  Even
   when you know that none of your files are fragmented, the volume's catalog
   files and/or the desktop database might be fragmented.
 
 
 ALIASES
 
 The following information is provided to clarify the use of aliases when
 making disc images:
 
 - If you check the RESOLVE ALIASES check box in the select folder dialog for
   creating ISO or hybrid images, all file aliases are replaced with the actual
   file in the disc image.  If not checked, only the file alias is included in
   the disc image.
 
 - The CHECK ALIASES function in the OPTIONS pulldown menu scans the selected
   partition/image for aliases and determines if there are aliases that point
   outside of that partition/image.  Before checking an ISO image for aliases,
   you must mount the ISO image.  It is not enough to select the folder from
   which you built it.
 
 Also, on page 4-4 of the manual, please replace step 3 with the following:
 
 3. Create the alias for each shared data file in the Macintosh volume and drag
    the alias icons to the ISO folder.
 
 You can also alias folders, as well as files.
 
 
 CUSTOMIZING HFS ICONS
 
 You can customize the icon for an HFS or hybrid disc when mounted on a
 Macintosh by following these steps:
 
 1. Create and mount the temporary HFS partition.
 
 2. Do a GET INFO on the application whose icon you wish to use.
 
 3. Click on the icon in the GET INFO window to highlight it.
 
 4. Use APPLE-C to copy the icon to the clipboard.
 
 5. Do a GET INFO on the HFS partition icon.
 
 6. Click on the icon to highlight it.
 
 7. Use APPLE-V to paste the new icon.
 
 The mounted partition should now have the new icon.  At this point you can
 record the disc.  When you mount the disc in your CD-ROM drive, the new icon
 appears instead of the default icon.
 
 
 CHANGING A VOLUME'S ALLOCATION BLOCK SIZE
 
 The allocation block size for the source volume should be a multiple of 2K.
 To check the allocation block size, click the INFO button in the SELECT VOLUME
 window.
 
 To change a volume's allocation block size, you need to reinitialize the
 volume.  Most SCSI formatting software allows you to specify the allocation
 block size.  If your software does not have this option, you can force a
 specific block size by using one of these volume sizes:
 
    Volume size        Default block size
    -------------------------------------
       96 - 127M              2K
      224 - 225M              4K
      352 - 383M              6K
      480 - 511M              8K
      608 - 639M             10K
      736 - 767M             12K
      864 - 895M             14K
     992 - 1023M             16K
    1120 - 1152M             18K
    1248 - 1279M             20K
    1376 - 1407M             22K
    1504 - 1535M             24K
    1632 - 1663M             26K
    1760 - 1792M             28K
    1888 - 1919M             30K
    2016 - 2047M             32K
 
 Volumes created with the CREATE TEMPORARY PARTITION command will always have
 the optimum block size.
 
 
 COPYING A CD-ROM DIRECTLY
 
 CD-IT!ALL allows you to copy a CD-ROM directly.  To do this, insert the CD-ROM
 into your CD-ROM player.
 
 If the CD-ROM is a Macintosh HFS CD-ROM, you can use the MACINTOSH HFS disc
 type and select the volume as usual.
 
 If the CD-ROM is an ISO 9660 or a hybrid CD-ROM, use the GENERIC CD-ROM disc
 type and select the CD-ROM drive.
 
 If your Macintosh rejects the CD-ROM, turn off the extensions and restart.
 
 Note:  CD-IT!ALL cannot check whether the disc is in fact a CD-ROM.  Also, you
 cannot copy a CD-i, CD-DA, or a CD-ROM XA disc.
 
 
 
 CHANGES MADE FOR VERSION 2.5.2:
 ===============================
 
 
 SOFTWARE UPDATE
 
 The following changes have been made for CD-IT!ALL version 2.5.2:
 
 - Support was added for Video CD disc images.  This is covered more fully in
   the ñVideo CD Capabilityî section.
 
 - Changes were made to the Generic CD-ROM format options and the ISO 9660
   Builder window.  These changes are covered more fully in the ñGeneric CD-ROM
   Format Optionsî and The ñISO 9660 Builder Windowî sections, respectively.
 
 - CD-IT!ALL did not work properly when used with a Philips CDD522/Kodak PCD225
   and certain older Macintosh models.  This has been fixed.  CD-IT!ALL
   requires firmware 2.01 or higher; versions 1.0x are no longer supported.
 
 - Support for the JVC XR-W2001 and the Pinnacle RCD-1000 has been added. 
   ISRC and UPC codes currently do not work with the Pinnacle RCD-1000 and
   other JVC-based writers.
 
 - CD-IT!ALL supports CD Plus, which is the upcoming standard for interactive
   albums.  CD Plus discs have audio in the first session and CD-ROM XA in the
   second session.  CD-IT!ALLÍs hybrid capabilities have been enhanced to allow
   for Hybrid/CD-ROM XA in the second session.  The HFS part of a hybrid second
   session cannot be access with the currently shipping version of AppleÍs CD
   ROM driver.
 
 - Some writers, such as the Yamaha CDR100, Ricoh RS-9200CD, Kodak PCD600, and
   Philips CDD521 with firmware prior to 2.0, do not support audio indexes. 
   CD-IT!ALL did not always remind you that your audio indexes would be
   ignored.  This has been fixed.
 
 - CD-IT!ALL 2.5.2 requires that you have System 7.5 or System Update 3.0
   installed.
 
 
 VIDEO CD CAPABILITY
 
 You can now use Video CD disc images in CD-IT!ALL.  To record a Video CD
 image, you need to select the Video CD option from the CD-ROM menu.  
 
 To load a Video CD image, use the following procedure:
 
 1. Click on Data in the main window to display a standard Macintosh open file
    window.
 
 2. Click on the name of the Video CD image that you want to display.
 
 3. Click on the OPEN button.  Clicking on CANCEL returns you to the main
    window without loading any data.
 
 The name of the selected Video CD disc image should now be displayed in the
 DATA field of the main window.
 
 
 GENERIC CD-ROM FORMAT OPTIONS
 
 A new dialog window was added to the Generic CD-ROM format options when
 copying from SCSI devices which allows you to copy only part of a hard disc or
 CD-ROM.  Now when you select your SCSI device from the SELECT SCSI DEVICE
 window and click on OK, the SCSI device descriptor window is displayed.
 
 The SCSI device descriptor window provides information about the SCSI device
 such as the capacity, block size, and number of blocks.  The SCSI device
 descriptor window allows you to specify the following information:
 
 - COPY
   Enter the number of either blocks or megabytes of the SCSI device to copy.
   Then, select whether you are specifying blocks or megabytes by using the
   pulldown menu.
 
 - START AT BLOCK
   Enter the number of the block at which to begin the copy.  If you specify 0,
   CD-IT!ALL copies from the start of the device.
 
 
 THE ISO 9660 BUILDER WINDOW
 
 The ISO 9660 BUILDER window has been changed and provides the following fields
 and check boxes:
 
 - VOLUME NAME
   Enter the name that you want the volume to be called. 
 
 - FORMAT
   Select the image format that you want to use for the ISO 9660 image.  The
   following options are available from the pulldown menu:
 
   - CD-ROM
     Select CD-ROM if you want to use CD-ROM as the image format.  If you
     select CD-ROM, you cannot create a multisession disc.
 
   - CD-ROM XA
     Select CD-ROM XA if you want to use CD-ROM XA as the image format.  If you
     want to use a multisession disc, you need to select CD-ROM XA.
 
   - ELECTRONIC BOOK
     Select ELECTRONIC BOOK if you want to use the Electronic Book image
     format.  If you select ELECTRONIC BOOK, you also need to select the
     language to use for the format.  The following languages are available
     from the pullright menu:
     
            English   French   German   Italian   Japanese   Spanish
 
 - NAMING
   Select the naming convention set that you want to use:
 
   - ISO 9660 LEVEL 1
     Select ISO 9660 LEVEL 1 if you want CD-IT!ALL to adhere to the ISO 9660
     Level 1 naming conventions.  If you use ISO 9660 naming, all file and
     folder names are converted to contain only uppercase A-Z, the digits 0-9,
     and the underscore (_) character.  To create a fully ISO 9660 Level 1
     conformant disc, you should also check APPEND VERSION NUMBERS.  If you
     select ISO 9660 LEVEL 1, directory names cannot have extensions.
 
   - ALLOW MS-DOS NAMES
     Select ALLOW MS-DOS NAMES if you want CD-IT!ALL to allow MS-DOS file
     naming conventions.  The ISO builder allows non-ISO 9660 naming
     conventions to be used when you select ALLOW MS-DOS NAMES.  However,
     selecting ALLOW MS-DOS MANES causes CD-IT!ALL to create a disc that does
     not fully conform to ISO 9660.  Directory names may have extensions.
 
   - ALLOW MACINTOSH NAMES
     Select ALLOW MACINTOSH NAMES if you do not want any file name conversion
     to take place.  Discs created with ALLOW MACINTOSH NAMES selected most
     likely will not conform to the ISO 9660 standard, but will work without
     any problems on Macintosh computers and most UNIX systems.  You cannot use
     discs created with this options on systems running the MS-DOS/Windows
     operating systems.  If you select ALLOW MACINTOSH NAMES, you cannot select
     APPEND VERSION NUMBERS (;1).
 
   - APPEND VERSION NUMBERS (;1)
     If your filenames do not contain version numbers, check APPEND VERSION
     NUMBERS (;1) to append a version number to each filename while building
     the disc image.  This saves you the time of manually changing each
     filename to include a version number.
 
   - USE APPLE EXTENSIONS
     Check USE APPLE EXTENSIONS if you want CD-IT!ALL to allow Apple extension
     to ISO 9660.  If you do not check USE APPLE EXTENSIONS, only the data
     forks of Macintosh files can be written to and read from CD-ROM.
 
 
 
 CHANGES MADE FOR VERSION 2.5.3:
 ===============================
 
 
 - Support for the Sony CDU920S/CDU921S.
 
 - Support for the Ricoh RS-1060C.  This should be considered "beta", as it has
   not been tested with a production version of the drive.
 
 - Support for Eastman-Kodak bar coding (Kodak writers only).
 
 - VERIFY calculates a CRC checksum for the disc.  The checksum is displayed
   in the VERIFICATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY window, and is automatically
   placed on the clipboard.  AstartÚ's CD-Copy product uses the same algorithm
   to create a checksum for a given disc, thus enabling you to verify the
   integrity of the disc at a later date.
 
 - Improved compatibility with Powerbooks and 68030-based Macintosh computers.
 
 - Version 2.0 of CD-IT! CD Reader automatically mounts all volumes of a
   multivolume HFS disc on the desktop.  
 
 
 
 CHANGES MADE FOR VERSION 2.5.6:
 ===============================
 
 
 - The final version of the Ricoh RS-1060C is now supported.
 
 - The Philips CDD2000 is now supported.
 
 - The image driver now updates the modification date and time of the HFS image
   file when the contents of the respective temporary partition is changed. 
   The update only takes place after dragging the mounted temporary partition
   icon from the desktop to the trash.
 
 - Hidden directories are now supported in the ISO format.  Previously, only
   hidden files were allowed.
 
 - CD-IT! CD Reader version 2.0.3 supports the new recorders.
 
 - A trash folder and a desktop folder are now automatically created on
   bootable CDs.
 
 - In the Generic CD-ROM format, option-click on the DATA button directly
   displays the SCSI dialog. Option-click on the OK button in the OPTIONS
   dialog saves the current settings as default.
