Installing:    Script2disc Edition 219, for the Macintosh



Edition 219 fixes problems with flashing -- uncoordinated transprency

control --  that can occur before and after Run-Length animations.



The file s2d219.tar is in tar format and contains just the OS-9 modules

used by the CD-i disc when running on a player.  To extract the modules

from the tar file, you'll need an OS-9 copy of tar, which can be downloaded

from this BBS, in the OS-9 File section.  tar must be copied to the CMDS

folder in the MediaMogul folder, on your Mac.





Installation:



1. From your Mac Finder, make a duplicate of the CDIMAGES folder (located in

the SCIPT2DISC folder).



2. From your Mac, make a JUNK folder inside the MediaMogul folder.  Copy

s2d219.tar into that folder.



3. Start CDIPlayback, and select the CD-RTOS mode (be sure and reset

CDIPlayback).  Hit 'return' a few times to assure a $ prompt is present.



4. At the $ prompt, type:



        chd /h0/JUNK

        tar -xvf s2d219.tar



Wait for tar to extract all the files...



5. After tar finishes, verify that all the modules are intact, by

typing:     ident -q cdi*



All the modules should have a GOOD CRC.





6. From the Mac Finder, open the JUNK folder in the MediaMogul folder.

Select ALL the files there (command-A) and drag them to the CDIMAGES

folder (not the COPY of CDIMAGES) in SCRIPT2DISC folder on your Mac,

replacing the existing files there.



7. Start Script2Disc and open your project file. Re-select the WORKING

FOLDER so it points to the CDIMAGES folder, NOT the CDIMAGES COPY folder.

Script2Disc tends to remember your OLD working folder even after it is

renamed.



Installation is complete.
