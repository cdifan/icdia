                         os9dump for the Sun



os9dump is substantially the same utility as dump on an OS-9 computer.

It presents a raw hexadecimal/ASCII display of any file specified. It works

equally well with OS-9 and Sun files of any type.



Syntax and command help can be obtained by typing:



                os9dump -\?





See the "dump" utility in the OS-9 Technical manuals for further

details.
