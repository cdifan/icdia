                             Ident for the Sun



Ident is a Sun4 executable that can be used to display the header

information on an OS-9 module.  This is useful for Script2Disc users in

identifying the correct edition and version, sticky and sharable modes,

etc. and for programmers who wish to check modules in libraries.



This Sun version of ident does not support the abbreviated report mode

with the -q option.  It only displays the long report.



Help and syntax can be displayed by typing "ident' without options or a

filename.



See OS-9 Technical reference manuals for further details on

ident.
