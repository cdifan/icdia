<H2><CENTER>Line Termination and Invisible Characters</CENTER></H2>


<P>
Strange and vexing problems can occur if your scripts or menus are not properly line terminated, or have invisible characters contained within.  Here's a few hints:
<UL>
<LI>If you manually type in your scripts in a text editor, be sure to put a hard CR, or CR/LF, or LF at the end of each line.  If your editor does a "soft" text wrap, script2disc may see 2 lines of script as only one, and get confused.<BR><BR>

<LI>Some editors seem to randomly generate high ascii or invisible characters, which are not apparent when viewed in a low ascii only font.  To check for this, try to find a font which will display something(anything) for all high ascii characters.<BR><BR>

<LI>End of line termination is especially important on the <I>last</I>&nbsp;line of your scripts, and particularly when using Mac script2disc.  If the last line of your script does not contain a carriage return at the end, it will still play fine in simulation.  But when you build the title, the first line of the <I>next</I>&nbsp;script will not be executed in emulation, or on the cd.<BR><BR>

<LI>If you build your scripts and menus on a 605 professional player, and then run script2disc on a PC or Sun, a text file conversion utility is handy.  Text files made in OS9 do not display properly on the Sun or PC, because of line-termination differences between the platforms.  This does not affect proper operation of script2disc, but can make it hard to diagnose problems, or make changes.   For reference purposes, the line-termination of the various platforms is:<P>
