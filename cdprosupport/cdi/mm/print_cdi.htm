<P>
 You can print text or graphics from any CD-i player.<BR><BR>
<LI>On consumer players, you must print to the serial /t2 port on the back of the player.  If you want to print to a parallel printer, you will need to use a serial->parallel converter.  Consult the cables page for the proper printing cable pinouts.
<P>

<LI>On professional players, you can print to any of  the serial ports(/t2,/t3, or /t4), or the parallel port(/p).  Printing to the parallel port is significantly faster than the serial method.
<P>

<LI>There is a freeware subroutine in the OS9 file section, <B><I>cdi_mmpr</I></B>, which will do basic printing chores.  For more sophisticated printing options, the Printer Manager Plug-in is required.

<P>
<LI>There is also a way to print files without either of the subroutines above.  This method does not have any of the error condition checking that <B>cdi_mmpr</B> or the <B>Printer Manager</B> plugin possess.   The steps to follow are thus:
<P>
<OL>
<B><LI></B>Create your output print file with whatever text or graphics program you like on your PC.<BR>

<B><LI></B>Be sure you have the  printer drivers installed for the destination printer.  Choose that printer, but print to a file, e.g. "stuff.txt".<BR>

<B><LI></B>In order to print the file on a CD-i player you will need to use the "<CODE>copy</CODE>"  command in OS9.  The copy command does not alter the file in any way, so text files must have proper line terminations to print correctly.    <BR>

<B><LI></B>Use the "Call" command in MediaMogul to load   <CODE>copy</CODE>.  Use the "filename" as the parameter of the <CODE>copy</CODE> call.  <BR>

<B><LI></B> A simple script might look like this:<BR><BR>

<CODE>00:00		Call			/h0/cmds/copy stuff.txt /t2</CODE><BR><BR>

<B><LI></B>Beware of trying to print large graphics files serially.  These will take a <B>long</B> time to print.
