<H2><CENTER>MediaMogul Scripts are ASCII Text Files</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
Did you know that MediaMogul Script and Menu files are simply ASCII text
and can be edited, copied, pasted, templated, and replicated using any text
editor and many spreadsheet programs? For training and education titles
using virtually identical scripts, other than asset names, multiple file
search and replace or paste techniques can be used to manufacture hundreds
or even thousands of scripts in a short time. Advanced MediaMogul titlers
have learned the simple scripting language and type out much of their title,
using the ScriptWriter to play and fine tune the project. The scripting
language, command spellings, syntax and example script lines for each command
are documented in the ScriptWriter Reference Section of the manual.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A shareware text editor for the Macintosh, <I>BBEDIT Lite</I>, is particularly
suited for use with MediaMogul scripting. It is one of the few text editors
that perform find and replace on MULTIPLE files in a folder. Changing path
names, times, or parameters can be very efficient.<BR>
<BR>
Another useful utility for manipulating script files the Macintosh is <I>NameDropper</I>
. NameDropper is an AppleScript droplet that runs batch string operations
on filenames. You can add a string to the beginning or end of the filenames,
substitute a string within the filenames, or delete a string. <BR>
<BR>
NameDropper requires <I>Finder Liaison 1.1</I>.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Both BBEdit Lite and NameDropper can be found on AOL and many Macintosh
Web ftp sites.<BR>
