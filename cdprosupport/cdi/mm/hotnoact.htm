There may be times when you want to have a hotspot where no action is performed if it is clicked in.  An example would be a transparent hotspot that would allow the user to see what showed through when the cursor was over the hotspot, but that did not branch or perform any other action if they clicked while in the hotspot.
<P>
You can do this by entering a &#34;&#36;&#34;, rather than a script or command, in the Branch to Script field for the hotspot while in the Menu Editor.  Simply leaving the Branch to Script field blank in the Menu Editor will not work.  While the hotspot will be there, it will allow a click to be performed in it and the click will attempt a branch to &#34;&#47;&#34;.  If this is a branch with return, this has the effect of going on to the next column in your script, while if it is a branch no return it will exit your title.
<P>
There are other effects than simply a transparent hotspot that this could be used this for.  Some would be using this with Run Length Linked Hotspots or Run Length Animated Hotspots for different effects.  You can probably think of others.
