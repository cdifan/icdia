<LI>request Master 4.4 to enable use within Win '95.  This update is available to current owners of Master or VCDMaster 4.3.1.</OL>
<P>

<LI>On Windows NT, you can just shell out to NT's version of DOS and 
run master from there.

<LI>script2disc 2.2.1 requires Windows 3.x, and will not run in '95 or NT. However, an updated dll library file, available upon request to current owners of s2d 2.2.1, will enable use in Windows 95.   NT operation has not been fully tested, and is not currently supported.
