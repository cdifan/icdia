<CENTER><H2>Easy Viewing of Mogul.log</H2>
</CENTER>
The log file (mogul.log) created when playing a script with debug is very useful at finding scripting errors and tracing branch flow.   However, it can't be viewed from the ScriptWriter or the File Director unless you abort the play.  If you have a PC or Macintosh development system you can create a shortcut to view the log file from a text editor on the host side. On the Macintosh, simply create an alias of Mogul.log and drag it to your desktop.  The log can be easily viewed in Simpletext or other text editor without disturbing the ScriptWriter.  On the PC, create a Program Item for Mogul.log and Associate the extension .log with your favorite Windows text editor.
