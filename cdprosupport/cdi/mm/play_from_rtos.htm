<H2><CENTER>Emulating or Playing a CD from CD-RTOS</CENTER></H2>


<B>Overview:</B>
<P>


You can start a CD-i title from an OS-9 <B>$</B> or <B>CD-RTOS</B> prompt, and still retain the ability to type commands, like MFREE, MDIR, PROCS and other useful items WHILE the title runs.  This allows the developer to run various OS-9 diagnostic utilites while the title emulates or the CD plays.  See other troubleshooting articles for useful diagnostic techniques and utilities that can be used in this mode.
<P>


<B>For Macs or PC's running CDIPlayback:</B>
<P>
<HR>
<B>Before doing step 1:</B>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If testing an emulated image:
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	* Put CDIPlayback into "CD-RTOS" mode.<BR>
	* RESET CDIPlayback.<BR>
	* Wait until you see a $ prompt in the terminal window.<BR>
	* Under the File Menu, "open" a disc image (.cd file).<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

If testing a CD-i CD:
<P>


	<BLOCKQUOTE>* Put CDIPlayback into "CD-RTOS" mode.<BR>
	* RESET CDIPlayback.<BR>
	* Wait until you see a $ prompt in the terminal window.<BR>
	* Be sure and wait until the CD icon or interface button indicates the CD is mounted.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>1</B>. In the terminal window (where the $ prompt is), type:
<P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>chx /h0/cmds<BR>
	chd /cd<BR>
	dir  -e /cd/CDI<BR></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>


Look for a file near the beginning of the listing with the suffix <CODE>.MM0</CODE>. The <CODE>.MM0</CODE> file is the script2disc built CD-i application.
<P>


<B>2.</B> You MUST be sitting at the root of /cd.  Run the command "pd" if you  are unsure.
<P>


<B>3.</B> Type the EXACT name of that file with its path (exact case and spelling) with an & at the end of the filename. 
<P>


			<CODE><BLOCKQUOTE>for example:<BR><BR>  /cd/cdprosupport/MY_SCRIPT.MM0&</BLOCKQUOTE></CODE>
<P>

  
An <B>&</B> forces the application to run as a background process, permitting the <B>$</B> to re-appear. 
<P>


<B>4. </B>The system will return a number, like <CODE>+5</CODE>, the $ prompt will return, and then the title will begin to play on the CD-i monitor.
<P>
<B5.</B> Type any valid OS-9 command, like MFREE, to examine various aspects of title performance.
<P>
<BR>


<B>For 605 Development Players:</B>	
<P>
		

If testing a CD, then insert the CD into the 605 drive. If testing an emulated image, 
start the emulation on the emulator (for example, emulate image.cd). Wait for the 
emulation software to start and issue the "<CODE>stop at sector 0</CODE>" message, then proceed.  The 
605 should be put into EXTERNAL/INTERNAL mode as appropriate for emulate or CD playback. 
<P>


<B>1.</B> With a terminal, or equivalent PC or Mac, connected to port 3, click on the SETTINGS icon, then SYSTEM icon (from the power on Philips screen).  A $ prompt will appear on the terminal screen.
<P>


Note: If the SYSTEM icon is not visible, assure that a terminal or 
equivalent is connected to the 605 on port 3, and that the RAM setting is at least 0.5 
Meg.  Power cycle the 605 to force it to look at port 3 again.  Try step 1 again.
<P>


<B>2.</B> On the terminal type:
<P>
	<CODE><BLOCKQUOTE>chx /h0/cmds<BR>
	chd /cd<BR>
	dir  -e /cd/CDI<BR></BLOCKQUOTE></CODE>
<P>


Look for a file near the beginning of the listing with the suffix <CODE>.MM0</CODE>.  Use CNTRL-S 
and CNTRL-Q to pause/continue the display as necessary. The <CODE>.MM0</CODE> file is the CD-i 
application.
<P>


<B>3.</B> Type the EXACT name of that file with its path (exact case and spelling) 
with an & at the end of the filename.
<P>

An <B>&</B> forces the application to run as a background process, permitting the <B>$</B> to re-appear.. 
<P>


<B>4. </B>The $ prompt will return, and the application will begin to play on the CD-i 
screen.
<P>
<B>5.</B> Type any valid OS-9 command, like MFREE, to examine various aspects of title performance.
