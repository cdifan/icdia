 Recently, Philips discovered an anomaly in how various models of CD-i players<BR>
respond to volume level adjustment.  The anomaly only effects ADPCM volume, and<BR>
effects CD-i applications made under MediaMogul, ShowMaster and &quot;C&quot; programming<BR>
tools.</FONT></P>

Since the first CD-i players were available, Philips has continually sought to further<BR>
reduce production costs and increase reliability.  Their efforts were concentrated at<BR>
reducing circuit complexity as newer player models were designed.  Philips tracks these<BR>
complexity reductions via levels of &quot;monolithicness&quot; of the main circuit board.  For<BR>
example; The first player models, like the 910, were termed &quot;maxiMMC&quot;.  The first<BR>
U.S. 220 model (220/17) was &quot;miniMMC&quot;, the second generation 220/37 was &quot;Mono I&quot;,<BR>
the third generation 220/57 was &quot;Mono II&quot; and so on.  The 220/97--the newest 220--is<BR>
&quot;Mono IV&quot;.  The professional and portable CD-i players also carry similar monolithic<BR>
designations.  A complete chart of model versus board level follows later in this article.</FONT></P>

Over the many board changes, the ADPCM attenuator unit has inadvertently been<BR>
altered and thus does not respond to application volume commands in the same<BR>
manner across the many Philips player models.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=4>
The CD-i player attenuator unit design is regulated by the Green Book specification for<BR>
CD-i as follows:</FONT></P>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>
There are FOUR separately controllable attenuators in the unit:</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
<UL>
<LI>R-R - manipulates signal passing from unit RIGHT input to unit RIGHT output<BR>
<LI>L-L - manipulates signal passing from unit LEFT input to unit LEFT output (<BR>
<LI>R-L - manipulates how much signal passes from unit RIGHT input to unit LEFT output<BR>
<LI>L-R - manipulates how much signal passes from unit LEFT input to unit RIGHT output</UL>
</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Each attenuator is adjustable in 1 dB increments from NO attenuation (0 dB<BR>
attenuation) up to MAXIMUM attenuation (128 dB attenuation).  Thus, there are 128<BR>
discrete settings for each of the four attenuators.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Note: The R-L and L-R attenuators in most applications are set to maximum<BR>
attenuation (128 dB) so that no left/right signal mixing occurs.  MediaMogul does not<BR>
permit R-L or L-R attenuator adjustment.  MediaMogul permits R-R and L-L adjustment<BR>
together through its VOLUME command.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
The anomaly is manifested as a departure from the 1 dB per increment behavior described<BR>
above.  None of the players exhibit linear (1 increment yields 1 dB change) attenuator<BR>
response over their entire range, and some of the players do not follow the<BR>
1dB/increment spec over any of their range.</FONT></P>

The attenuator anomaly divides the players among &quot;Mono&quot; versions.  Mono III and<BR>
Mono IV machines deviate the most, while Mono II and previous versions are closer to<BR>
the spec.  For the Groups below, assume if no /xx number is specified that it applies to<BR>
all machines of that model.  The list below is only for U.S. players, and is current as of<BR>
this document.</FONT></P>

<B>Group 1 players have the following response:</B></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=4>
<UL>
<LI>For each increment change in attenuation (a setting of 255 -&gt; 254 in Mogul), there will<BR>

<LI>Any attenuation settings greater than 53 dB yield NO further attenuation--i.e. it bottoms<BR>
out at -53 dB.
<LI>A setting of 128 dB attenuation will not fully attenuate or mute the signal.</FONT>

<B>Group 2 players have the following response:</B></FONT></P>

<UL>
<FONT SIZE=4>
<LI>For each increment change in attenuation (i.e. 255 -&gt; 254 in Mogul), there will be a 0.5<BR>
dB change until you reach 28 dB attenuation (Mogul setting of 191).
<LI>Attenuation bottoms out at 31.5 dB until an attenuator setting of 126 (129 in Mogul) is<BR>
reached.  
<LI>At attenuator settings of 127 and 128 (128/127 in Mogul) the attenuation<BR>
jumps to 100 dB (essentially muted).

</TABLE></P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Both Groups have irregular response, though Group 1 players are not available for sale<BR> 
any longer.  This leaves the highly aberrant Group 2 players.<P>


In light of the attenuator response, we recommend that developers simply produce<BR>
ADPCM assets carefully--monitoring levels closely between all ADPCM clips in the<BR>
title, and also taking care to match levels to the MPEG assets.  The second part of the<BR>
recommendation is to leave the attenuator settings at NO attenuation (255 in Mogul).<BR>
This is the ONLY setting that produces the same attenuation (albeit NO attenuation) across ALL player groups.</FONT></P>
