One thing that can cause confusion when using CDIPlayback on a Macintosh is not being able to use the Macintosh keyboard to enter information into MediaMogul.  This can happen if there is not an active, blinking, insertion point in the terminal window for CDIPlayback on your Macintosh monitor.  Simply click in the terminal window and your keyboard should now work.  If it does not, check the serial connection between the I2m bnoard and your Macintosh.  &#40;See below.&#41;

Another thing that can happen is not having a &quot;&#36;&quot; prompt in the terminal wiondow for CDIPlayback on your Macintosh monitor when you are in CD-RTOS mode.  When this occurs, selections from Execute Commands from the Action menu will not work.  If you experience this, check that the serial cable between your I2m board and the Macintosh modem port is connected.  This cable should be plugged into the correct port on the I2m board, the port immediately adjacent to where your mouse or trackerball is connected to the board, and the other end must be connected to the modem port on the Macintosh.  If this is either not firmly connected, or is not connected at all, there will be no communication between your Macintosh and the I2m board.  If the cable is plugged into the correct ports on the Macintosh and the I2m card, try swapping it with another cable.  This cable is a standard Macintosh peripheral cable and is used to connect many serial devices to a Macintosh.

You must set the MediaMogul directory as &#47;h0 in CDIPlayback.  If you move your MediaMogul folder, you need to change this setting to reflect the new location.  You do this by selecting &#34;Set MediaMogul directory&#34; from the Action Menu in CDIPlayback.  This has three selections, h0,dd, and h1.  Select h0 and a Macintosh browser will show on your screen.  Use this to navigate to the location of your MediaMogul folder.  Open your MediaMogul folder and click the &#34;Set Directory&#34; button.  If there is no &#34;Set Directory&#34; button, but there is an &#34;Open&#34; button, select a document, not a folder, in the list area of the browser.  The button will now be &#34;Set Directory&#34;.  Click this button and the browser will go away.  Your MediaMogul directory is now set.
