When trying to change discs from the MediaMogul startup disc to a different disc or disc image containing, for example, mpeg assets, some PC's have a problem recognizing the second disc.  This problem has a workaround:
The key factor is that you have to do a <CODE>dir</CODE> of the cd between ejecting the MM cd and opening the image file.  This clears things out somehow.  This problem is fixed in the new version, now called MediaAuthor 1.5.1.

<OL>
<B><LI></B>Start MediaMogul.
<B><LI></B>At the MM shell, choose CD-RTOS.
<B><LI></B>eject  the MM cd using the eject menu command or button in Playback. 
<B><LI></B> type:<BR>
<CODE>dir /cd</CODE><BR>
 in CD-RTOS.  (No quotes.  Actually getting a directory of...nothing.) Repeat this command until you get a #000:244 error.  This error indicates that the MM cd has been cleared out of memory completely.
<B><LI></B> Load the cd image with the Open command <B>or</B> ,if applicable,<BR>
 replace the MediaMogul disc with the second disc and close the drawer. 
<B><LI></B> Mount the second disc by clicking the mount button once (on some systems, twice).
<B><LI></B> type:<BR>
 <CODE>dir /cd/GREEN</CODE><BR>
 (e.g.) to confirm that it's reading the disc/disc image properly.  When it's not working, it sees subdirectories as files, and won't open them or give a directory of them.
</OL>

<B><FONT COLOR="#AA1177" SIZE="4">For MediaAuthor 1.5.1, the steps for changing cd's are:</FONT></B>
<OL>
	<B><LI></B>Start MediaMogul
	<B><LI></B>Click on <CODE>CD-RTOS</CODE> to get an OS9 shell.
	<B><LI></B>At the MM shell <CODE>CD-i></CODE> prompt, type <CODE>mm_eject</CODE>. The MediaMogul cd should eject.
	<B><LI></B>Replace the cd with the second disc or open an image file.  You should now have access to it.
</OL>

Neither of these procedures are strictly necessary, as it is now possible to boot off the hard drive without the MediaMogul cd present.  See the <A HREF="../mm/NO_CD.htm">No CD page.</A>
