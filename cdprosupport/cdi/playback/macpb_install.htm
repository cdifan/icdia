If you have deleted parts of CD-i Playback for Macintosh, or are having trouble with your current installed copy, you may need to reinstall the software.  In order to avoid problems, we have found it best to reinstall using this procedure:
<OL>
<LI> Delete all remnants of the old installation first.  These include:

<UL DINGBAT="binary.document"><LI>The <I><B>CDIPlayback</B></I>&nbsp; application, which should be in your MediaMogul folder.
<LI>The <I>!<B>CDIPlayback Init</B></I>, which is in the System:Extensions folder.
<LI>The <I><B>CDIPlayback Stuff</B></I>&nbsp; folder, which also is in the System:Extensions folder.
<LI DINGBAT="binary.document">The <I><B>CDIPlayback Prefs</B></I>&nbsp; file which is in the System:Preferences folder.
</UL>
<LI>Reboot your Macintosh with the extensions off.  This is accomplished by pushing the Shift key down until the message
"Extensions Disabled" appears in the Welcome to Macintosh dialog.
<LI>Reinstall the CD-i Playback software according to the manual.
<LI>Reboot.
</OL>
