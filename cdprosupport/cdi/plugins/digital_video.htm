</H2><P><BR>
<B>Overview:</B>
<P>
The Digital Video Plug-In provides a method for playing MPEG full motion
video in a CD-i title created with MediaMogul.
<P>

<B>Plug-ins required for operation:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>cdi_sgmn</CODE> - The &quot;Signal Manager&quot; plug-in.<BR>
<CODE>cdi_dvpl</CODE> - The &quot;Digital Video Play&quot; plug-in.  Allows playing of
digital video.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B>MediaMogul Utilities required to prepare assets:</B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="../../encoding/ep/epassist.htm"><CODE>Entrypoint Assist</CODE></A> (<CODE>epassist</CODE>) is used
to make entrypoint files.  Entrypoint files are required to use some functions
such as Scan (both forward and back), INTIME, OUTTIME, STILL, JUMP, Bookmarking,
etc.  Functions which require entrypoint files are identified in the Digital
Video Plug-In manual.
<P>
<LI>The <A HREF="../../avconv/imgmaker/imgmaker.htm"><CODE>ImageMaker</CODE></A> utility software for Macintosh and Windows is
used to make <CODE>.rtf</CODE> files and disc images of MPEG
files for playing scripts using the Digital Video Plug-In in Simulation from
Script Writer.  <CODE>ImageMaker</CODE> requires <CODE>master</CODE> software,
</UL>available as part of <CODE>script2disc</CODE>, in order to work.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you are using a Philips development CD-i player and/or an OS-9 Emulator,
you will need to create a <CODE>master</CODE> script for converting each
<CODE>.mmd/.mpg</CODE> file to an <CODE>.rtf</CODE> file
(<A HREF="greening.htm">Example script</A>) and also to build a disc image
(<A HREF="dvxampl2.htm">Example script</A>).  Then a disc must be written
prior to Simulation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<B>Assets to create before using plug-in:</B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>MPEG <CODE>.mmd (.mpg)</CODE> files of the required video must be
encoded and multiplexed.
<LI>Entrypoint files may need to be created for use of some functions.
<LI>Foreground and background pictures may need to be created for use with
 menus.
<LI>Menu file(s) need to be created if menus will be used with the Digital
Video.
<LI>MPEG <CODE>.rtf</CODE> (Real Time Files) must be made if you wish to
play the MPEG in Simulation from the Script Writer.
<LI>A disc containing the <CODE>.rtf</CODE> files of the MPEG will need to
be created if you wish to play scripts using the plug-in in Simulation from
the Script Writer.
</UL>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE:</B> For additional information on creating MPEG
<CODE>.rtf</CODE> files and on building a disc image of these, see &quot;Preparing
MPEG for MediaMogul 2.2 Applications&quot;, available from pmpro
Professional Support. You can also consult the pages immediately below:

<B>Special preparations:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No additional preparation required.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<B>How plug-in works:</B>
<P>
&#183; You should call the digital video plug-in, <CODE>cdi_dvpl</CODE>,
in TEST mode early in your title.  The plug-in will check for the presence
of a digital video card, and set the Z variable to 500 if none is found.
 Then have a <CODE>Br_ifeq_nr</CODE> if Z is 500 to a script that alerts the
user that the title requires a digital video card.
<P>
&#183; Calling the digital video plug-in will automatically start the signal
manager plug-in, <CODE>cdi_sgmn</CODE>, so make sure you do not call this
more than once.
<P>
&#183; Digital Video is displayed on the background video plane in CD-i.
 The foreground video planes must be made transparent, either partially or
completely, in order for it to be seen.  Use the <CODE>DV_Transp</CODE> video
command to set up the type of transparency you want, and then use a Cut,
Curtain, or Wipe video transition with the DV checkbox checked to establish
the defined transparency once decoding of the digital video starts.
<P>
&#183; After the digital video has been played, you must turn off the
transparency that had been established by using a Cut, Curtain, or Wipe video
transition without the DV checkbox checked.
<P>
&#183; If you want to change transparency parameters, e.g. go from a CLUT
0 to a matte transparency, or vice versa, you must first turn off the existing
transparency before establishing the new one.
<P>
<P>
<B>Example:</B>
<P>
In the following example, the digital video plug-in is called in TEST mode
to check for the presence of a Digital Video card.  Then an entrypoint file
is loaded and a 9 second portion of MPEG is played at full screen CLUT 0 transparency
 with a hidden, toggleable menu.
