<H2><CENTER>Model 350 Portable CD-i Player &amp; Speaker Interference<BR>
</CENTER>
</H2>
October 1995,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is confirmed that the internal speaker to the 350 portable causes mechanical
resonance, disturbing the laser mechanism.  Lockups or player resets during
playback - especially during playback of DV - are common.  The laser mechanisnm
is particularly sensitive to frequencies in the voice range (500 Hz - 3
KHz) and when the volume is at normal volumes (65dB SPL) or higher.  <BR>
<BR>
The problem can be worked around by disabling the internal speaker,  by
plugging in headphones or a dummy plug (or external powered speaker) to
the  headphone jack.  Lowering the volume will also help. <BR>

January 1996,<BR>
<BR>
Philips now has re-engineered spindle mechanisms available for the 350 portable.
  Contact the vendor you purchased the player from, or contact the nearest
Philips or Philips Key Modules repair facility.<BR>
