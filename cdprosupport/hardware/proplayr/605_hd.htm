Q: (Customer) reports that DV playback is affected by when the hard drive is<BR>
powered up vis-a-vis the 605.  If the hard drive is powered up before the 605:<BR>
DV problems.  Powering up the hard drive last solves it.   Has anyone else heard of this?  <P>

<FONT COLOR="8F0B34">A:<Q>" It's the TERMPWR isolation problem.  If an external drive provides +5v for<BR>
TERMPWR, it feeds back into the SCSI interface and fouls up the power-on<BR>
reset logic.  Remember, for a while the expansion board SCSI connectors had<BR>
the TERMPWR tooth removed from the connector.  I suppose that it was assumed<BR>
that something else would supply TERMPWR in this case.<BR>
I've noticed reset problems on the 602 where if the external SCSI drive is<BR>
on and the 602 is off (the 602's front panel power LED is glowing but you<BR>
might not see it if there's a lot of ambient light) if you power on the 602<BR>
sometimes the CD controller does not get reset and gives 244 errors or<BR>
hangs.  Also the console startup messages report "CD software release 0.0"<BR>
when this happens.  I've seen the floppy act flakey, too.  (A customer's)<BR>
605/FMV will not work either if the hard drive is powered before the 605.<BR>
I thought that cutting the TERMPWR tooth off was a reasonable solution since<BR>
there was no isolation on the +5v.  Now is looks like the tooth is back, but<BR>
I noticed no obvious change to the board to isolate TERMPWR.  It's obviously<BR>
not since reset is a problem."</Q><BR></FONT>
