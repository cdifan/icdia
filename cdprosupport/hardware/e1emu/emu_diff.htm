<B>E1 Emulator:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>* Useable with old 100 series Yamaha WORM recorders and  Philips Model CDD521 CD-R recorders.  It does NOT support the Philips CDD522 nor CDD-2000, nor most other manufacturer's recorders.<P>


* Emulator software version <CODE>4.1.x</CODE> supports 1x and 2x recording for CD-DA, CD-i, CD-ROM XA and ISO9660 disc formats.  It does NOT support the Video CD disc format at any speed.<P>


* Emulator software version <CODE>4.2.x</CODE> supports 1x recording for CD-DA, CD-i CD-ROM and ISO9660.  It does NOT support 2x recording for ANY disc format nor with any recorder.<P>


* VCD discs recorded with fixed size records will not play on Late Model 220 and other players.  The problem is that the Lead-In sectors created by the 521 for a Mode 2 track being recorded with fixed size (2336 byte) records does not contain a subheader.  The 521 also places Track Descriptor Information (TDI, as specified by the Orange Book) in these sectors beginning immediately after the header.  A player that expects these Lead-In sectors to have a valid subheader will interpret the first 8 bytes of TDI instead, since no subheader exists.  This seems to confuse them. The New Emulator, Model E2, is capable of writing in this fashion, and making valid Video CD recordings. The old emulator, Model E1, is not.  <P></BLOCKQUOTE>

Note:  The E1 emulator is larger that than the E2, has a 3.5" floppy drive on the front panel, and seven RCA (stereo-like) connectors on the rear panel.  The E2 emulator is about half the E1 size, has no floppy drive and has two small lamps on the front panel.<P>
