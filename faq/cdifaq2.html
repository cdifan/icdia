<B>CD-i FAQ 2000 Edition</B><BR><BR><BR>

<B>Section 2. CD-i Applications</B><BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="2.1">
<B>2.1 In what areas is CD-i used?</B><BR>
When CD-i was being designed in the mid 80s, it was supposed to function both as a consumer device, being sold as an addition to the family's entertainment centre (in a way similar to a VCR), as well as in professional areas. Initially, Philips and Sony expected CD-i to become the next "big thing" in consumer electronics, on which all future electronic developent would (partially) be based. <BR><BR>

Unfortunately, CD-i never took of that way in the consumer electronics market, leaving the system with a few 100,000s of units sold in America, a few 100,000s in Asia and about half a million in Europe. In the professional field however, CD-i became very popular. It quickly emerged to be the de-facto standard for easy-to use, TV-based interactive programs. CD-i was being used by dozens of companies for a wide variety of purposes. This proves that the system was very technology-proof, since its hardware specification never changed in the last decade of the past millenium in which it was extensively used. <BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="2.2">
<B>2.2 How was CD-i used as a consumer device?</B><BR>
CD-i was positioned a a multi-purpose device, unlike for example game consoles which had only one major function. It was this versatility that made CD-i unique, but it was this same versatility that made CD-i very hard to explain and hence sell to consumers.<BR><BR>

When I was asked to explain what CD-i could do back then, I usually said: "The CD-i player is used by the children in the morning to help them with their homework, some time later they play an exciting game on the device. In the afternoon, you plan your next holiday on your CD-i using some encyclopedias or travel guides. During dinner, the CD-i will function as an audio player providing background music. Grandma pays a visit, an excellent time to show your latest holidaypictures from a Photo-CD. And in the evening, you will all watch the latest blockbuster movie on Video-CD." This story used to indicate the true versatile ways in which CD-i could be used. <BR><BR>

CD-i consumer programs were, among others, available in the following areas:<BR><BR>

<LI>Children's titles</LI>
<LI>Games</LI>
<LI>Arts and Culture</LI>
<LI>Special Interest</LI>
<LI>Reference (encyclopedias)</LI>
<LI>Music</LI>
<LI>Karaoke</LI>
<LI>etc.</LI><BR><BR>

A few hundred consumer CD-i titles were available during CD-i's consumer years.<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="2.2.1">
<B>2.2.1 Who made consumer CD-i titles?</B><BR>
Most consumer CD-i titles were distributed by Philips. In 1986, Philips and PolyGram established AIM (American Interactive Media), a joint venture which had the mission to support the launch of CD-i on the consumer market with the full availablilty of titles. Just before the launch of CD-i onto the American consumer market in 1991, PolyGram resigned from AIM and the name was changed in PIMA (Philips Interactive Media of America). But the titles were already pressed, which is  why some early titles indicate PIMA on the cover of the box, but start with an AIM intro animation.<BR><BR>

Philips Interactive Media sold titles that were produced both by internal software studios, as well as for other software manufacturers, and in this way they handled the promotion, marketing and distribution for them.<BR><BR>

The Philips studios each were specialized in their own area. There was for example the Philips Sidewalk Studios, which produced excellent children's titles, Philips POV Entertainment Group, which developed the first games with real actors and Philips Freehand Studios, which developed titles that took CD-i's technology to the edges, such as Create your own Caricature or Face Kitchen.<BR><BR>

Among the studios that produced software for CD-i were Infogrames, SPC Group, Lost Boys, Valkieser, NOB, Codim, CapDisc, Fathom Pictures, Spinnaker Software, Microids, Mirage, PIMC, Epic Interactive Media, Radarsoft, US Gold, AVM and lots of others.
<BR><BR>

A lot of publishers, TV companies and game developpers licensed their characters and other material to Philips or its software partners to turn them into a CD-i title. Among them were Nintendo, Paramount Pictures, Miltron Bradly (MB), MGM, Bertelsmann, Oxford University Press, Compton's New Media, EMI, NBC, Hanna-Barbera, Virgin Interactive Entertainment, BBC, Manga Entertainment, Namco, Standaard Uitgeverij Antwerpen, Hachette, Playboy Enterprises, Richard Scarry, Motown Records, Don Bluth, Warner Bros., Time-Life, Smithsonian Institution, Vivid Video, American Laser Games, Ravensburger, Psygnosis and many others.<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="2.3">
<B>2.3 How was CD-i used in professional areas?</B><BR>
The biggest success for CD-i was in professional applications. CD-i was used in a wide variety of corporate and instutional environments, in such areas as:<BR><BR>

<LI>Point-of-information</LI>
<LI>Site-based advertising</LI>
<LI>Training</LI>
<LI>Educational</LI>
<LI>Background Music</LI>

<BR><BR>
Point-of-information applications used a CD-i player in some kiosk-like setup, enabling users to view information using for example a touchscreen. This allowed them for example to view all variations of a particular car model in showroom, or to find their ways in a museum. CD-i is an excellent medium for this kind of applications, because of its low cost, its easy to use interface and its high quality, TV-like video images.<BR><BR>

In another area, CD-i was also extensively used in training environments. CD-i allowed company work force to train themselves in a particular field, using their own speed, selecting their own areas of interest, while being given feedback by the system. Also here, CD-i has the main advantage of the lack of complicated installation procedures or compatibility issues usually found on PC-based setups.<BR><BR>

CD-i was also widely used in schools. Both primary and secondary schools used the system for a variety of puposed, ranging for training infants to used their eye-hand coordination skills up to teaching students about the arts of the Renaissance.

<A NAME="2.3.1">
<B>2.3.1 Which companies used CD-i?</B><BR>
Since CD-i is an open platform, not all uses of the system have to be reported to a single body such as Philips. It is known that CD-i was and is used by hundreds of companies all over the world in dozens of areas. Among them are the following companies:<BR><BR>
