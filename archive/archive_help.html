<B>ICDIA CD-i Software Archive</B> | <A HREF="index.html">Back to Overview</A>
<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Help Page</B>
<BR><BR><BR>
The ICDIA software archive was built from 1990 onwards by Jorg Kennis. The contents of these listings are owned by The New International CD-i Association. Please indicate a proper source referal (including web site URL icdia.co.uk) if you repurpose (parts) of these listings.<BR><BR><BR>

<I>The categories</I><BR><BR>

For easy reference, the titles in the archive are divided into a number of categories.<BR><BR>

The first five categories include titles that have been released trough regular sale channels onto the consumer market: <BR>
<B>- Games</B> includes all titles with a gaming element in them (such as arcade games, adventures, quizes, etc.), but it does not include titles that were especially developped for children or which have an emphasis on education or learning.<BR>
<B>- Kids</B> includes all titles that were especially developed for young children between the ages of 3 and 12 years.<BR>
<B>- Reference</B> includes all general purpose CD-i titles, including discs with reference works (such as encyclopedias), training, arts and culture, hobbies, learning, etc. <BR>
<B>- Music</B> includes all titles with an emphasis on music, such as musical biographies, karaoke titles and music videos (only in CD-i format, does not include Video-CD releases).<BR>
<B>- Movies</B> includes movies and other linear video programs in CD-i format. Does not include Video-CD releases.<BR><BR>

<B>- Professional CD-i titles</B> were developed with a single professional client in mind, and were not available for consumers trough regular retail channels. Titles include company presentations, training programs, point-of-sale, point-of-information, etc.<BR><BR>

The next two categories are very CD-i specific.<BR> 
<B>- CD-i demo discs</B> includes all titles that demonstrate either a particular CD-i title, several CD-i titles, or the CD-i system in general. Some of these titles were distributed to consumers as special offer discs, others were used in stores to demonstrate CD-i. This category does not include normal CD-i titles that were released for demonstration purposes, these are included in their respective category.<BR>
<B>- CD-i authoring</B> includes titles that can either be used to create CD-i titles or that can be used to assist the creation of CD-i titles. It also includes titles that demonstrate the features of CD-i authoring tools. These discs were especially developed for CD-i authoring studios. More info on CD-i authoring can be found in the <A HREF="../faq/cdifaq7.html">FAQ</A>)<BR><BR>

The CD-i related disc formats that can be played back on a CD-i player and other (dedicated) playback equipment. This includes<BR>
<B>- Photo-CD</B> discs with or without playlists and audio (more info in the <A HREF="../faq/cdifaq5.html#5.9">FAQ</A>), <BR>
<B>- CD-BGM</B> discs for professional background music (more info in the <A HREF="../faq/cdifaq5.html#5.5">FAQ</A>),<BR>
<B>- CD+Graphics</B> discs (more info in the <A HREF="../faq/cdifaq5.html#5.4">FAQ</A>) and<BR>
<B>- Video-CD</B> discs with movies, concerts, documentaries and other video material (more info in the <A HREF="../faq/cdifaq6.html">FAQ</A>).<BR><BR><BR>

<I>The fields</I><BR><BR>

For each of the titles in these listings, certain information is included, which is described below.<BR><BR>

<B>Title</B> indicates the full title of a disc or a disc set. Prefixes like 'the', 'a', 'la' and 'le' are included at the end of a title, so that these won't interfere with the alphabetical order of the lists.<BR><BR>

<B>Publisher</B> is the name of the company which released the particular title on the market, or which took care of its distribution. Throughout the lifespan of CD-i, Philips used several software publishing divisions and brand names on its consumer CD-i titels, like Philips Media, Philips Interactive Media, Philips Interactive Media of America and American Interactive Media. All of these are listed as Philips Media in the Publisher field.  <BR><BR>

<B>Producer</B> indicates the name of the company that created the actual CD-i software code on the disc. In case of a conversion of a title that is also available on other platforms, it does not include the name of the original creator (this is listed under Content), but the studio that programmed the CD-i version. For movies and other linear titles it indicates the company that created the CD-i software application on the disc.<BR><BR>

<B>Content</B> indicates the name of the company, persons or organization that provided the CD-i studio with their materials to create the title, or which licensed its format or intellectual property to be used on this particular title. This field may include the name of the original producer of an existing title that was ported to CD-i.<BR><BR>

<B>Date</B> included a year, month+year or an exact date as of when the title was included in the catalogues and being given a catalogue number by the publisher. In some cases, this release date/year might be earlier than the actual availability of a title onto the market.<BR><BR>

<B>Version</B> indicates what specific version of a title is owned by the ICDIA. In some cases, there is an FPD indication in this field. FPD is short for Final Product Delivery, which was used by Philips to number interim releases of a title that were used for testing or demonstration, before the actual title was completed). DEMO means that we own a demonstration version of this disc, released without the accompanying case or booklet. This field may also indicate a particular localized or translated version of a title, when this is not clear from the title of the disc (such as French, Spanish, EU or US). CD-R means that we own a copy on a CD-recordable disc. For movies, CD-BGM, Photo-CD ande Video-CD discs, this field indicates the name or version of the CD-i software application that is used on the disc.<BR><BR>

<B>Catalogue Number</B> lists the catalogue number of the <U>particular version</U> of the title that we own. Philips Media used to release a title in many different localized versions, which sometimes meant that the disc either was entirely translated in a particular language or contained a help voice or text in a certain language, but in most cases it just refers to the translate packaging. Several countries had specific requirements for the contents on the packaging (such as brand logos, age indication, warnings, or a translated promotional text). In these cases only the packaging varies from country to country, but the actual discs are identical. The 81xx numbers are European releases, the 31xx numbers are US releases.<BR><BR>

<B>DV</B> indicates wether the disc requires a Digital Video cartridge to be installed in the player to run the title (indicated as Yes), or when additional performance or functionality is obtained when a cartridge is present (indicated as Opt for optional).<BR><BR>

For Photo-CD, a <B>Category</B> is also mentioned. When this field lists 'CD-i', it means that the title is either about CD-i or Photo-CD itself, or that it was otherwise used to promote the CD-i or Photo-CD system.
